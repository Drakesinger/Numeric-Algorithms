This repository contains the labs for the Course Numeric Algorithms taught by [Stephane Gobron](http://www.stephane-gobron.net/) at HE-Arc.

## Lab 1 - Binary Number Representation
Used documentation:

One of the best books you can/should/must read: [Write Great Code Volume 1](https://www.nostarch.com/greatcode.htm)

It's follow-up: [Write Great Code Volume 2](https://www.nostarch.com/greatcode2.htm)

The code in lab one presents a memory leak during multiplication that was not fixed.
The fix is easy: Don't use pointers. You can just directly instatiate the objects.

## Lab 2 - Fixed Point Iteration Equation Resolution

Some tips:

## Lab 3 - Solving Linear Systems
## Lab 4 - Derivatives
This is worst of the labs and the one we have worked for the least. Time and will were missing. Quality is thus also missing.
## Lab 5 - Integrals
## Lab 6 - Differential Equations
